Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.   El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park (established 1914), is also on Stanford land.    Stanford also has the Stanford Golf Course   and Stanford Red Barn Equestrian Center   used by Stanford athletics though the golf course can also be used by the general public.  === Landmarks === Contemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and the Bing Concert Hall, the Stanford Mausoleum with the nearby Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish.

White and John B. White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.",
