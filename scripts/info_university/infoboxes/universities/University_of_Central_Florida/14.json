    "direction": "f Hitt, UCF has raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions.    Hitt's efforts have resulted in not only an increase in the university's academic profile, but also an on-campus football stadium, new arena, more on-campus housing, and the development of the UCF College of Medicine at Lake Nona. Until 1999, the Knights were represented by a jouster from the Medieval Times dinner show located in nearby Kissimmee, Florida. That same year, Knightro was introduced at the staple homecoming event, \"Spirit Splash.\"  The past decade has seen enrollment increase by over forty percent at UCF,   style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:auto;\"  class=\"wikitable\" |+ '''Demographics of student body'''      ! !!

In the new millennium, enrollment has increased by over sixty percent at UCF, from 33,453 in 2000,  to 60,810 in 2014.  Of the nearly 60,000 students, 15 percent are graduate and professional students, while women make up 55% of the student body. Nearly 20 percent of UCF faculty are minorities. According to the May 2009 edition of Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education magazine, UCF is one of the best 100 colleges in the United States for Hispanic students seeking bachelor's degrees.    24% of UCF students are above the age of 25.   Due to budget decreases and increased demands on the university, the UCF Board of Trustees, with the approval of the Board of Governors and the Florida Legislature, approved a 15% increase in tuition for the 2012\u201313 academic year.   For the 2015\u201316 academic year, undergraduate tuition costs were $212.28 per credit hour for in-state students, and $748.89 per credit hour for out-of-state students. ",
