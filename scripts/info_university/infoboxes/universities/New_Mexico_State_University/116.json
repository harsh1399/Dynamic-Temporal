It stated: \" Said institution is hereby located at or near the town of Las Cruces in the County of Do\u00f1a Ana, upon a tract of land of not less than one hundred (100) acres, This land could be contiguous to the main Las Cruces irrigating ditch, south of said town.\"  Designated as the land-grant college for New Mexico under the Morrill Act, it was named the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.

In 1972, the bell was rededicated as the NMSU Engineer's Bell and mounted on a platform near Goddard Hall. On game days, various school organizations took turns in toting the ringing bell around Las Cruces prior to kick-off. The Bell was then taken to Aggie Memorial Stadium where it saluted Aggie touchdowns with its distinctive &ndash; and loud &ndash; chimes. More recently, the bell has been permanently mounted at field level just behind the south goal post of the stadium.   ===\"A\" Tradition=== In 1920, students of then New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts scouted for an appropriate place to display their school letter. Tortugas Mountain, located three miles (5 km) east of campus, seemed a natural spot. Brave males gathered enough stones to form a big \"A\" easily visible from campus and the surrounding area. On the following day, April 1, students trudged up the mountain side with their five-gallon cans of whitewash and splashed it on the stones, turning them into a gleaming white \"A\". For many years, giving the \"A\" its annual fresh coat of whitewash was an all-school effort. The seniors mixed lime and water at the foot of the mountain and the freshmen and sophomores toted the mixture up to the juniors who splashed it on the \"A.\" With the growth of the university through the years, the tradition was taken over by the Greek Council.   ===The Pride of New Mexico Marching Band=== The marching band of New Mexico State University is known as the Pride of New Mexico. It is composed of approximately 200 of the best and finest musicians, dancers, and auxiliary in the state and in the nation. The intention of the \"PRIDE\" is to provide entertainment at football games, parades, and other NMSU events.    ===The Wonder Dog=== On every NMSU football kickoff, Aggie fans eagerly await the \"Wonder Dog\" to retrieve the kicking tee from the football field during home games. This fun tradition started in the mid 1990s. The first \"Wonder Dog\" was Smoki, a border collie-Australian shepherd mix born in Capitan, New Mexico, and trained by Joel Sims, an NMSU alumni. Smoki \"The Wonder Dog\" entertained the Aggie crowd for six years, even with defeat, and retired in 2002. She also debut in a Hollywood film which co-starred Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid, entitled \"Wyatt Earp\", as a town dog.   \"Smoki the Wonder Dog\" died at the age of 15 in 2005. Since then, the fun tradition ended until in 2012, a tryout for the next \"Wonder Dog\" took place to take over Smoki and to continue on the long time tradition. After the deliberation that took 2 hours, the panel of celebrity judges has officially chosen Striking as the next \"Wonder Dog\", following the legacy of Smoki. Striking \"The Wonder Dog\" is a 4 year old, border collie breed, owned and handled by Dr. Stochaj, a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New Mexico State University and also serves as Chair for the President's Research and Economic Development Committee. Striking first appeared on August 30, 2012 at the NMSU-Sacramento State home game.    ===Crimson Fridays=== Every Friday, some students, faculties, staff, and alumni of NMSU wear crimson colors to show support for the university and the school's sports program.    ===NMSU ring=== The official ring of New Mexico State University is given to students with junior and senior standing and alumni of NMSU to celebrate and commemorate each of the ring bearers'  achievement and NMSU traditions. The official Ring Ceremony is sponsored by the Alumni Association which is held every spring and fall Semester at the Aggie Memorial Tower.    The ring symbolizes dedication, hard work, and the pursuit of excellence. It is a tangible and lifelong reminder of the NMSU experience; the Organ Mountains, Horseshoe, Memorial Tower, the taste of red or green chile.  The official ring is manufactured by Balfour, which comes with white gold and yellow gold, with an optional stone; diamond or cubic zirconia at the centerpiece of the ring and is presented with Hatch Chile Ristra. The top of the ring highlights the NMSU three triangles school seal, encircled with the school name. The three triangles represent NMSU's role as a land grant University &ndash; teaching, research, and service. It also represents the connection of Spanish, American Indian, and Anglo cultures in New Mexico, and the triangulation of NMSU campus with Interstate 10 linking Interstate 25 in the first principle interchange of the Pan American Highway in North America. The one side of the ring shows the Aggie Memorial Tower, in honor of Aggies' who died for the country, and the other side of the ring displays a majestic Organ Mountains. Students wear the ring facing the school name.  Upon, granting of degrees, graduates should turn the ring around facing outward, which symbolizes that they are ready to face the world.    ===Noche de Luminarias=== A tradition that signals the beginning of the holiday season is the \"Noche de Luminarias\" or \"Night of Lights\". A university tradition that started as the President's Holiday Reception in 1984, which kick offs the holiday season with a night of entertainment and festivities. It is considered one of the largest luminaria displays in the state of New Mexico.    Each candle set is lit inside a paper bag. More than 6,000 luminarias, begins at the Educational Services Building, extending towards the International Mall and then encircle the Corbett Center Student Union. The display is being set up by the Las Cruces High School band, and will serenade the visitors as they walk through the lighted path by the Las Cruces High School Brass Choir.    ==Athletics== ",
