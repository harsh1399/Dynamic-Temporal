Argyros School of Business and Economics is located in the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Business and Technology Hall.   Founded in 1977, the school is named after George L. Argyros, a Chapman alumus and former U.S. Ambassador to Spain. Argyros has chaired the board of trustees of Chapman University since 1976, and has donated significant resources towards establishing Chapman as a leading national business school.   The business school was renamed in Argyros' honor in 1999. In 2019 the Argyros School celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the naming of the school, capped off with a special fundraiser dinner on October 9, featuring special guest President George W. Bush.   The event raised approximately $15 million for the school's endowment, $10 million of which was a surprise announcement by the Argyros family. The $15 million raised is believed to be the largest 1-day fundraising event in Orange County's history.    The Argyros School offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in business, including the Master of Business Administration and Master of Science.   In 2018 Chapman's full-time MBA program was ranked #73 by Bloomberg/Businessweek.    The Argyros School of Business and Economics was officially nationally ranked as the 60th Best Undergraduate Bloomberg BusinessWeek Business School in 2014. ",
