Over 60 percent of Penn State first-year students begin their education at a location other than University Park.   Each of these commonwealth campuses offer a unique set of degree programs based on the student demographics. Any student in good academic standing is guaranteed a spot at University Park to finish his or her degree if required or desired, known as \"change of campus\" or, more accurately, \"the 2+2 program\"; where a Penn State student may start at any Penn State campus, including University Park, for two years and finish at any Penn State the final two years. \"Why Should You Start Your Education at a Penn State Campus?\" Published by the Undergraduate Admissions Office, Pennsylvania State University. 2006.   === Special mission campuses and World Campus === thumb  ==== Special mission campuses ==== , Dickinson Law, founded in 1834 as The Dickinson School of Law in Carlisle, is the oldest law school in Pennsylvania   and the fifth oldest in the country. Over the years, its graduates have included the nation's finest attorneys, judges, government and corporate leaders, and legal educators. The Dickinson School of Law's 1997 merger with Penn State was completed in 2000. It expanded its reputation, network, and joint degree programs\u2014complementing Dickinson Law's legacy as an innovative leader in experiential education.   In 2006 a second campus was opened at University Park. The school was split in 2014 into two separately accredited law schools: Dickinson Law in Carlisle and Penn State Law at University Park.   The last students to attend the dual-campus Penn State Dickinson School of Law graduated in May 2017.   thumb , The Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies is a special mission campus offering master's degrees, graduate certification, and continuing professional education.

As such, although it receives funding from the Commonwealth and is connected to the state through its board of trustees, it is otherwise independent and not subject to the state's direct control. For the 2006\u20132007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania.",
