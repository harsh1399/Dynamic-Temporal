DCA sponsors or operates 113 athletic and non-sport clubs.   Many cadets join several clubs during their time at the academy and find their time spent with their clubs a welcome respite from the rigors of cadet life.   DCA is responsible for a wide range of activities that provide improved quality of life for cadets, including: three cadet-oriented restaurants,   the Cadet Store,   and the ''Howitzer'' and ''Bugle Notes''.   ''The Howitzer'' is the annual yearbook, while ''Bugle Notes'', also known as the \"plebe bible,\" is the manual of plebe knowledge. Plebe knowledge is a lengthy collection of traditions, songs, poems, anecdotes, and facts about the academy, the army, the ''Old Corps'', and the rivalry with Navy that all plebes must memorize during cadet basic training.       During plebe year, plebes may be asked, and are expected to answer, any inquiry about plebe knowledge asked by upper class cadets. Other knowledge is historical in nature, including information as found in ''Bugle Notes''. Lipsky (2003), p. 9.  However, some knowledge changes daily, such as \"the days\" (a running list of the number of days until important academy events),   the menu in the mess hall for the day, or the lead stories in ''The New York Times''.   Each cadet class celebrates at least one special \"class weekend\" per academic year. Fourth class cadets participate in Plebe Parent Weekend during the first weekend of spring break. In February, third class cadets celebrate the winter season with Yearling Winter Weekend. In late January the second class cadets celebrate 500th Night, marking the remaining 500 days before graduation. First class cadets celebrate three different formal occasions. In late August, first class cadets celebrate Ring Weekend, in February they mark their last 100 days with 100th Night, and in May they have a full week of events culminating in their graduation. All of the \"class weekends\" involve a formal dinner and social dance, known in old cadet slang as a \"hop,\" held at Eisenhower Hall.     Grant Hall, formerly the cadet mess hall at West Point, is now a social center.    == Athletics == ",
