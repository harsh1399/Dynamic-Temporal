Student enrolment steadily rose in the following years until SY 2003-2004 when enrolment peaked at 13,506 and 10,252 for 1st and 2nd semesters, respectively. In the years that followed, our student population has been on a downward trend, a phenomenon that is not unique to CPU considering that all other universities in Iloilo City have similarly experienced. Still CPU has remained as the university with the highest number of students in Iloilo City. The line graph below tracks the enrolment trend from 1997 to 2006.\". CPU President.
