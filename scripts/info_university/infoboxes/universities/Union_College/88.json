    "FSPI": " A variety of publications and organizations publish annual rankings of colleges and universities based on a wide range of quantitative and non-quantitative criteria.  These factors include such measures as class size, student-faculty ratio, acceptance rate, alumni giving rate, graduation and retention rate, and peer assessment of academic quality.  Not surprisingly, considerable controversy surrounds these efforts; the Annapolis Group of Liberal Arts Colleges, of which Union College is a member, has issued several recent statements about the methodology and results of these attempts at comparative ranking of institutions of higher education.  Probably the best known is issued by ''U.S. News & World Report'', which first began ranking colleges and universities in 1983.  Variations on such a ranking system are also published annually by ''Forbes'' magazine, ''The Washington Monthly'', ''Princeton Review'', and the American Council of Trustees and Alumni.  A rather different approach has been taken by the National Survey of Student Engagement.  Another means of comparison is the earning power of their graduates. |",
