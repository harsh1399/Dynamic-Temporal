Michael Luttig said.  David J. Garrow, professor of history at the University of Cambridge, stated that the Court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government. "We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House of Representatives", Professor Garrow said. "Each side is putting forward only ideological purists."   According to the \'\'Vanderbilt Law Review\'\' study, this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is "a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law."  A poll conducted in June 2012 by \'\'The New York Times\'\' and CBS News showed just 44% of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing. Three-quarters said justices\' decisions are sometimes influenced by their political or personal views.    ==Criticism== The court has been the object of criticisms on a range of issues. Among them:  ===Judicial activism=== The Supreme Court has been criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by engaging in judicial activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology. See for example "Judicial activism" in \'\'The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States\'\', edited by Kermit Hall; article written by Gary McDowell  An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in \'\'Lochner v. New York\'\', which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts,', "root['author5']": 'Ed Meese', "root['author6']": 'Phyllis Schlafly', "root['author7']": 'Howard Phillips', "root['author8']": 'Alan E.
