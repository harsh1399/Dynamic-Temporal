    "homepage": "Wideo  is an online video creation platform that allows users to create, edit, and share online videos free of charge. Wideo\u2019s platform allows individuals who do not have previous video making or design experience to create explainer videos, animated presentations, video e-cards and more.   Users can choose (or upload their own) images, backgrounds, and sound that they desire in order to create their own personalized online video. That video can then be shared on social networks or embedded in websites or blogs.  Wideo provides its users with a library of elements, objects, backgrounds and fonts. Users can drag-and-drop elements into place in the Wideo editor then set the sequence of animations within their specific scenes. Each element can be re-used and the timing of the animation of each image can be individually adjusted.  Wideo offers its services on a freemium income model, where customers can use the tool and share or embed their videos for free. However, should the user wish to remove the Wideo watermark branding, or download the video directly to their computer, they can choose between three paid packages. By mid 2013, over 30,000 individuals, businesses, schools, students and teachers, were using Wideo to create over 17,500 online videos.",
