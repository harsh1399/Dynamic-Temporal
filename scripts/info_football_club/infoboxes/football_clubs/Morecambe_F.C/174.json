With a smile that lights up any room, She's the kind of person who dispels gloom.  Her heart is big, her spirit bright, She's always ready to lend a hand and fight. For what she believes in, for what is right, She's the kind of person who shines so bright.  Elly Jo, oh Elly Jo, A name that's hard to forget, you know. With a laugh that's infectious and warm, She's the kind of person who can weather any storm.  So here's to Elly Jo, a friend so true, May her days be filled with joy and laughter, too. For she deserves all the happiness in the world, A shining star, a true gem, a pearl.",
