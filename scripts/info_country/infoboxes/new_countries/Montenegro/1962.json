    "today": "thumb|left|Ruins of the ancient city of Doclea Modern-day Montenegro was more and more known by that name in the historical period following the fall of the Serbian Despotate.   Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i tribe, but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the Crnojevi\u0107 noble family took power in Upper Zeta.  The aforementioned region became known as ''Stara Crna Gora'' 'Old Montenegro' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of ''Brda'' '(The) Highlands'. Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the Ottoman Empire, which saw the annexation of Old Herzegovina and parts of Metohija and southern Ra\u0161ka. Its borders have changed little since then, losing Metohija and gaining the Bay of Kotor.  After the second session of the AVNOJ during World War II in Yugoslavia, the contemporary modern state of Montenegro was founded as the ''Federal State of Montenegro'' (Montenegrin: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 / ''Savezna dr\u017eava Crne Gore'') on 15 November 1943 within the Yugoslav Federation by the ZAVNOCGB. After the war, Montenegro became a republic under its name, the ''People's Republic of Montenegro'' (Montenegrin: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Narodna Republika Crna Gora'') on 29 November 1945. In 1963, it was renamed to the ''Socialist Republic of Montenegro''  (Montenegrin: \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Socijalisti\u010dka Republika Crna Gora''). As the breakup of Yugoslavia occurred, the SRCG was renamed to the ''Republic of Montenegro'' (Montenegrin: \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Republika Crna Gora'') on 27 April 1992 within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by removing the adjective \"socialist\" from the republic's title. Since 22 October 2007, a year after its independence, the name of the country became simply known as ''Montenegro''. The country is known as ''Mali i Zi'' (lit. black mountain) in Albanian,   while it is known as Crna Gora in Bosnian as well as in Croatian.  == History == ",

Grand Duke Mirko Petrovi\u0107, elder brother of Knjaz Danilo, led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans with 15,000 troops at Grahovac on 1 May 1858. This forced the Great Powers to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, ''de facto'' recognizing Montenegro's independence.  In the Battle of Vu\u010dji Do Montenegrins inflicted a major defeat on the Ottoman Army under Grand Vizier Ahmed Muhtar Pasha. In the aftermath of the Russian victory against the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878, the major powers restructured the map of the Balkan region. The Ottoman Empire recognised the independence of Montenegro in the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.  The first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855. Under Nicholas I (ruled 1860\u20131918), the principality was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878. Nicholas I established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire.",
