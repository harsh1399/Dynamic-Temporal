The economy of Montenegro is mostly service-based and is in late transition to a market economy. According to the International Monetary Fund, the nominal GDP of Montenegro was $4.376 billion in 2016.  The GDP PPP for 2016 was $10.428 billion, or $16,749 per capita.  According to Eurostat data, the Montenegrin GDP per capita stood at 46% of the EU average in 2017.   The Central Bank of Montenegro is not part of the euro system but the country is \"euroised\", using the euro unilaterally as its currency.  GDP grew at 10.7% in 2007 and 7.5% in 2008.   The country entered a recession in 2008 as a part of the global recession, with GDP contracting by 4%. However, Montenegro remained a target for foreign investment, the only country in the Balkans to increase its amount of direct foreign investment.   The country exited the recession in mid-2010, with GDP growth at around 0.5%.   However, the significant dependence of the Montenegrin economy on foreign direct investment leaves it susceptible to external shocks and a high export/import trade deficit.  In 2007, the service sector made up 72.4% of GDP, with industry and agriculture making up the rest at 17.6% and 10%, respectively. ",
