    "direction": "Resignation of the democratic ministers after the Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat in 1948. The last independent government in Eastern Europe had become communist. Alekseev alexander 4.jpg|Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Praha 19891122-419-02.jpg|The Velvet Revolution ended 41 years of authoritarian Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989.    After World War II, Czechoslovakia was reconstituted and Jozef Tiso was executed in 1947 for collaboration with the Nazis. More than 80,000 Hungarians   and 32,000 Germans   were forced to leave Slovakia, in a series of population transfers initiated by the Allies at the Potsdam Conference. thumb|left|Slovakia became a member of the European Union in 2004 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. The end of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989, during the peaceful Velvet Revolution, was followed once again by the country's dissolution, this time into two successor states. The word \"socialist\" was dropped in the names of the two republics, i.e. the Slovak Socialist Republic was renamed Slovak Republic. In July 17, 1992 Slovakia, led by Prime Minister Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar, declared itself a sovereign state, meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government. Throughout the autumn of 1992, Me\u010diar and Czech Prime Minister V\u00e1clav Klaus negotiated the details for disbanding the federation. In November the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on 31 December 1992.  The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic went their separate ways after 1 January 1993, an event sometimes called the Velvet Divorce.     Slovakia has remained a close partner with the Czech Republic. Both countries co-operate with Hungary and Poland in the Visegr\u00e1d Group. Slovakia became a member of NATO on 29 March 2004 and of the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 1 January 2009, Slovakia adopted the Euro as its national currency.  == Geography == ",
