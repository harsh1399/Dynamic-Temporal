    "footnote_c": "thumb|right|upright=0.9|A Venus from Moravany nad V\u00e1hom, which dates back to 22,800 BC Radiocarbon dating puts the oldest surviving archaeological artefacts from Slovakia \u2013 found near Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom \u2013 at 270,000 BCE, in the Early Paleolithic era. These ancient tools, made by the Clactonian technique, bear witness to the ancient habitation of Slovakia.  Other stone tools from the Middle Paleolithic era (200,000 \u2013 80,000 BCE) come from the Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t (Prepo\u0161tsk\u00e1) cave in Bojnice and from other nearby sites.   The most important discovery from that era is a Neanderthal cranium (c. 200,000 BCE), discovered near G\u00e1novce, a village in northern Slovakia.  Archaeologists have found prehistoric human skeletons in the region, as well as numerous objects and vestiges of the Gravettian culture, principally in the river valleys of Nitra, Hron, Ipe\u013e, V\u00e1h and as far as the city of \u017dilina, and near the foot of the Vihorlat, Inovec, and Tribe\u010d mountains, as well as in the Myjava Mountains. The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of mammoth-bone (22,800 BCE), the famous Venus of Moravany. The statue was found in the 1940s in Moravany nad V\u00e1hom near Pie\u0161\u0165any. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile gastropods of the Tertiary period have come from the sites of Z\u00e1kovsk\u00e1, Podkovice, Hubina, and Rado\u0161ina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the Mediterranean and central Europe.  === Bronze Age === File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: a Celtic Biatec coin Right: five Slovak crowns The Bronze Age in the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800 BCE.  Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in \u0160pania Dolina) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.  After the disappearance of the \u010cakany and Velatice cultures, the Lusatian people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian hill forts document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.  === Iron Age ===  ==== Hallstatt Period ==== The arrival of tribes from Thrace disrupted the people of the Kalenderberg culture, who lived in the hamlets located on the plain (Sere\u010f) and in the hill forts like Molp\u00edr, near Smolenice, in the Little Carpathians. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. Common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries.   A special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the \"Princes\" of the Hallstatt period disappeared in Slovakia during the century before the middle of first millennium BC, after strife between the Scytho-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught the interest of emerging Celtic tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.  ==== La T\u00e8ne Period ==== From around 500 BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by Celts, who built powerful ''oppida'' on the sites of modern-day Bratislava and Dev\u00edn. Biatecs, silver coins with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique P\u00fachov culture, with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the \"Velkobysterecky\" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as Cotini.  ==== Roman Period ==== File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of Tren\u010d\u00edn (178\u2013179 AD) From 2 AD, the expanding Roman Empire established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the Danube, the largest of which were known as Carnuntum (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and Brigetio (present-day Sz\u0151ny at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of Rusovce, currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian vicus and several farms of the villa rustica type. The name of this settlement was Gerulata. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the Cananefates. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in Dev\u00edn Castle (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of D\u00fabravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.  Near the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the Limes Romanus, there existed the winter camp of Laugaricio (modern-day Tren\u010d\u00edn) where the Auxiliary of Legion II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic Quadi tribe in 179 CE during the Marcomannic Wars. The Kingdom of Vannius, a kingdom founded by the Germanic Suebian tribes of Quadi and Marcomanni, as well as several small Germanic and Celtic tribes, including the Osi and Cotini, existed in western and central Slovakia from 8\u20136 BCE to 179 CE.  === Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries === In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the Huns began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377 AD and occupied Pannonia, which they used for 75 years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the Avars, conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the Pannonian Plain, and established an empire dominating the Carpathian Basin.  In 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by Samo, a Frankish merchant. ",

Alekseev alexander 4.jpg|Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Praha 19891122-419-02.jpg|The Velvet Revolution ended 41 years of authoritarian Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989.    After World War II, Czechoslovakia was reconstituted and Jozef Tiso was executed in 1947 for collaboration with the Nazis. More than 80,000 Hungarians   and 32,000 Germans   were forced to leave Slovakia, in a series of population transfers initiated by the Allies at the Potsdam Conference. thumb|left|Slovakia became a member of the European Union in 2004 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. The end of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989, during the peaceful Velvet Revolution, was followed once again by the country's dissolution, this time into two successor states. The word \"socialist\" was dropped in the names of the two republics, i.e. the Slovak Socialist Republic was renamed Slovak Republic. In July 17, 1992 Slovakia, led by Prime Minister Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar, declared itself a sovereign state, meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government. Throughout the autumn of 1992, Me\u010diar and Czech Prime Minister V\u00e1clav Klaus negotiated the details for disbanding the federation. In November the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on 31 December 1992.  The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic went their separate ways after 1 January 1993, an event sometimes called the Velvet Divorce.     Slovakia has remained a close partner with the Czech Republic. Both countries co-operate with Hungary and Poland in the Visegr\u00e1d Group. Slovakia became a member of NATO on 29 March 2004 and of the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 1 January 2009, Slovakia adopted the Euro as its national currency.  == Geography == ",
