Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military \"d\u00e9cideurs\", known as \"le pouvoir\" (\"the power\"), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man may be Mohamed Medi\u00e8ne, the head of military intelligence.   In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired. After the death of General Larbi Belkheir, Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at Sonatrach, and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely.    The head of state is the President of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms, but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation.   The next presidential election was planned to be in April 2019, but widespread protests erupted in 22 February against the president's decision to participate in the election, which resulted in President Bouteflika announcing his resignation on 3 April https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/02/algeria-latest-news-president-abdelaziz-bouteflika-resigns. Algeria has universal suffrage at 18 years of age.  The President is the head of the army, the Council of Ministers and the High Security Council. He appoints the Prime Minister who is also the head of government. Articles: 85, 87, 77, 78 and 79 of the Algerian constitution thumb|President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and George W. Bush exchange handshakes at the Windsor Hotel Toya Resort and Spa in T\u014dyako Town, Abuta District, Hokkaid\u014d in 2008. With them are Dmitriy Medvedev, left, and Yasuo Fukuda, right.  Algeria is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer. Giving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) that came into force in 2014. It has a budget of \u20ac15.4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.  In 2009, the French government agreed to compensate victims of nuclear tests in Algeria. Defense Minister Herve Morin stated that \"It's time for our country to be at peace with itself, at peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations,\" when presenting the draft law on the payouts. Algerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first step and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation.    Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the Western Sahara have been an obstacle to tightening the Arab Maghreb Union, nominally established in 1989, but which has carried little practical weight.    ===Military=== ",
