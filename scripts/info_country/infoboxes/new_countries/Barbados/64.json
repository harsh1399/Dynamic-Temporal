The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms.

The three points of the trident represent in Barbados the three principles of democracy - \"government of, for and by the people.\"  The broken trident is set in a centered vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.  The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government.
