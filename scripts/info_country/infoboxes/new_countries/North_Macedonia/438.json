Compelled by the Soviet Union with a view towards the creation of a large South Slav Federation, the Bulgarian government once again offered to give Pirin Macedonia to such a United Macedonia in 1945. However this region remains a part of Bulgaria. thumb|Josip Broz Tito was the leader of SFR Yugoslavia from 1944 to 1980. Pictured: Tito with the US president Richard Nixon in the White House, 1971.  In 1944 the Anti-Fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) proclaimed the People's Republic of Macedonia as part of the ''People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia''.   ASNOM remained an acting government until the end of the war. The Macedonian alphabet was codified by linguists of ASNOM, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 and the principles of Krste Petkov Misirkov. During the civil war in Greece (1946\u20131949), Macedonian communist insurgents supported the Greek communists. Many refugees fled to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia from there. The state dropped ''Socialist'' from its name in 1991 when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia.  The new republic became one of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation.

Paeonia was inhabited by the Paeonians, a Thracian people,   whilst the northwest was inhabited by the Dardani and the southwest by tribes known historically as the Enchelae, Pelagones, and Lyncestae; the latter two are generally regarded as Molossian tribes of the northwestern Greek group, whilst the former two are considered Illyrian.              In the late 6th century BC, the Achaemenid Persians under Darius the Great conquered the Paeonians, incorporating what is today the Republic of North Macedonia within their vast territories.",
