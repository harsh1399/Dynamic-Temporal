In 1770, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's national day. The European population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the time of an 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system and wealthy market economy. The final constitutional ties between the United Kingdom and Australia ended in 1986 with the passing of the Australia Act 1986 which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Australia became a sovereign, independent and federal nation.  Politically, Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories.
