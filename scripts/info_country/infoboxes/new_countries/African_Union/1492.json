The declaration lastly noted the \"importance of involving the African peoples, including Africans in the Diaspora, in the processes leading to the formation of the Union Government.\"  Following this decision, a panel of eminent persons was set up to conduct the \"audit review\". The review team began its work on 1 September 2007. The review was presented to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government at the January 2008 summit in Addis Ababa. No final decision was taken on the recommendations, however, and a committee of ten heads of state was appointed to consider the review and report back to the July 2008 summit to be held in Egypt.   At the July 2008 summit, a decision was once again deferred, for a \"final\" debate at the January 2009 summit to be held in Addis Ababa.  ==== Role of African Union ====",

At the July 2007 Accra summit the Assembly finally decided to adopt a Protocol on Relations between the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities.   This protocol is intended to facilitate the harmonisation of policies and ensure compliance with the Abuja Treaty and Lagos Plan of Action time frames.  === Selection of the chairperson === In 2006, the AU decided to create a Committee \"to consider the implementation of a rotation system between the regions\" in relation to the presidency. Controversy arose at the 2006 summit when Sudan announced its candidacy for the AU's chairmanship, as a representative of the East African region. Several member states refused to support Sudan because of tensions over Darfur (see also below). Sudan ultimately withdrew its candidacy and President Denis Sassou-Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo was elected to a one-year term. At the January 2007 summit, Sassou-Nguesso was replaced by President John Agyekum Kufuor of Ghana, despite another attempt by Sudan to gain the chair. The year 2007 was the 50th anniversary of Ghana's independence, a symbolic moment for the country to hold the chair of the AU\u2014and to host the mid-year summit at which the proposed Union Government was also discussed. In January 2008, President Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania took over as chair, representing the East African region and thus apparently ending Sudan's attempt to become chair\u2014at least till the rotation returns to East Africa.   The current chair is South Africa.  ==== List of chairpersons ===="
