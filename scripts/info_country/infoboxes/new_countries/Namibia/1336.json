        "Overall, 26 percent of men age 15\u201349 and 32 percent of those age 50\u201364 have been circumcised. HIV prevalence for men age 15\u201349 is lower among circumcised (8.0 percent) than among uncircumcised men (11.9 percent). The pattern of lower HIV prevalence among circumcised than uncircumcised men is observed across most background characteristics. For each age group, circumcised men have lower HIV prevalence than those who are not circumcised; the difference is especially pronounced for men age 35\u201339 and 45\u201349 (11.7 percentage points each). The difference in HIV prevalence between uncircumcised and circumcised men is larger among urban than rural men (5.2 percentage points versus 2.1 percentage points).",
        "HIV prevalence among respondents age 15\u201349 is 16.9 percent for women and 10.9 percent for men. HIV prevalence rates among women and men age 50\u201364 are similar (16.7 percent and 16.0 percent, respectively).",
        "HIV prevalence peaks in the 35\u201339 age group for both women and men (30.9 percent and 22.6 percent, respectively). It is lowest among respondents age 15\u201324 (2.5\u20136.4 percent for women and 2.0\u20133.4 percent for men).",
        "Among respondents age 15\u201349, HIV prevalence is highest for women and men in Zambezi (30.9 percent and 15.9 percent, respectively) and lowest for women in Omaheke (6.9 percent) and men in Ohangwena (6.6 percent).",
        "In 76.4 percent of the 1,007 cohabiting couples who were tested for HIV in the 2013 NDHS, both partners were HIV negative; in 10.1 percent of the couples, both partners were HIV positive; and 13.5 percent of the couples were discordant (that is, one partner was infected with HIV and the other was not).  As of 2015, the Ministry of Health and Social Services and UNAIDS produced a Progress http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/NAM_narrative_report_2015.pdf Report in which UNAIDS projected HIV prevalence among 15\u201349-year-olds at 13.3% 12.2\u201314.5% and an estimated 210,000 200,000\u2013230,000 living with HIV.
