A representation of the Cisa can be seen on the weather vane of the Perlachturm; moreover, according to legend, some representations on the bronze doors of the cathedral are said to indicate the goddess. The mountain on which her temple is said to have stood was called \"Zisenberk\".   The golden vane on top of Perlach-Tower next to city hall is the original likeness of the goddess from the 15th century.  ==== The Stoinerne Ma ==== The \"Stoinerne Ma\" (\"Stony Man\") is a life-size stone figure on the eastern Augsburg city wall in the area of the so-called \"Sweden staircase\", which is located in the immediate vicinity of the Galluskirche and St. Stephan convent (on the outside of the city wall). It is probably a one-armed baker with a loaf of bread and a shield. In the area of the feet there is a helically twisted pedestal.  According to the legend, it is the baker \"Konrad Hackher\" who, during a long siege of the city, baked bread from sawdust and threw it into the ditch clearly visible for the besiegers over the city wall. The impression that Augsburg would still have so much bread that one could throw it over the wall is said to have demoralized the besiegers so much that they fired at him with a crossbow out of anger. A hit struck off his arm, and soon afterwards the siege was broken off. Historically, the event belongs to the Thirty Years' War, more precisely to the siege of Augsburg during the years 1634/35, when Catholic Bavarian troops under Field Marshal von Wahl wanted to recapture the city occupied by the Protestant Swedes. Of course, the baker's deed is not reliably proven.  The statue is often visited by walkers strolling along the city wall. As it is said to be a fortunate thing to touch the stone figure's iron nose. This custom is particularly popular with lovers.  ===== Bei den sieben Kindeln =====  In the wall of the property ''Bei den Sieben Kindeln 3'' (\"At the seven infants 3\") there is a recessed stone relief from the Roman period depicting six playing, naked children standing around a coffin.  Legend says that the commemorative plaque was commissioned by a Roman officer to commemorate the drowning of one of his children (therefore it is said to be \"seven\" children, although the plaque represents only six: the seventh child is drowned and lies in the coffin). According to current knowledge, the plate once formed the long side of a Sarcophagus, representing Erotes.  ==Incorporations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! Year!!
