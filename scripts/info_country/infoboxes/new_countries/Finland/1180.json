Finland subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 42.6 years.   Approximately half of voters are estimated to be over 50 years old.       Finland has an average population density of 18 inhabitants per square kilometre. This is the third-lowest population density of any European country, behind those of Norway and Iceland, and the lowest population density in the EU. Finland's population has always been concentrated in the southern parts of the country, a phenomenon that became even more pronounced during 20th-century urbanisation. Two of the three largest cities in Finland are situated in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area\u2014Helsinki and Espoo,  and some municipalities in the metropolitan area have also shown clear growth of population year after year, the most notable being J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4, Nurmij\u00e4rvi, Kirkkonummi, Kerava and Sipoo.   In the largest cities of Finland, Tampere holds the third place after Helsinki and Espoo while also Helsinki-neighbouring Vantaa is the fourth. Other cities with population over 100,000 are Turku, Oulu, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio, and Lahti.  thumb = right |caption = Religions in Finland (2019)  |label1 = Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland |value1 = 68.72 |color1 = DodgerBlue |label2 = Orthodox Church |value2 = 1.10 |color2 = Orchid |label3 = Other Christian |value3 = 0.93 |color3 = DarkOrchid |label4 = Other religions |value4 = 0.76 |color4 = Chartreuse |label5 = Unaffiliat",
