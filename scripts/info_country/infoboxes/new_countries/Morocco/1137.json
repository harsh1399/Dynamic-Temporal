        "'''Sub-Mediterranean:''' It influences cities that show Mediterranean characteristics, but remain fairly influenced by other climates owing to their either relative elevation, or direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean. We thus have two main influencing climates:  :",
        "''Oceanic:'' Determined by the cooler summers, where highs are around",
        "''Continental:'' Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter summers and colder winters, than found in typical Mediterranean zones. In summer, daily highs can get as high as",
        "'''Continental:''' This type of climate dominates the mountainous regions of the north and central parts of the country, where summers are hot to very hot, with highs between",
        "'''Alpine:''' This type of climate is found in some parts of the Middle Atlas Mountain range and the eastern part of the High Atlas Mountain range. Summers are very warm to moderately hot, and winters are longer, cold and snowy. Precipitation varies between 400 and 1200 mm. In summer highs barely go above",
        "'''Semi-arid:''' This type of climate is found in the south of the country and some parts of the east of the country, where rainfall is lower and annual precipitations are between 200 and 350 mm. However, one usually finds Mediterranean characteristics in those regions, such as the precipitation pattern and thermal attributes. Notable cities are Agadir, Marrakesh and Oujda.  South of Agadir and east of Jerada near the Algerian borders, arid and desert climate starts to prevail.  '''Note:''' Due to Morocco's proximity to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, two phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures, either by raising temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when sirocco blows from the east creating heatwaves, or by lowering temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when cold damp air blows from the northwest, creating a coldwave or cold spell. However, these phenomena don't last for more than 2 to 5 days on average.  Countries or regions that share the same climatic characteristics with Morocco are California (USA), Portugal, Spain and Algeria.",

File:Barbary lion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Barbary lion Morocco has a wide range of biodiversity. It is part of the Mediterranean basin, an area with exceptional concentrations of endemic species undergoing rapid rates of habitat loss, and is therefore considered to be a hotspot for conservation priority.   Avifauna are notably variant.   The avifauna of Morocco includes a total of 454 species, five of which have been introduced by humans, and 156 are rarely or accidentally seen.    The Barbary lion, hunted to extinction in the wild, was a subspecies native to Morocco and is a national emblem.  The last Barbary lion in the wild was shot in the Atlas Mountains in 1922.   The other two primary predators of northern Africa, the Atlas bear and Barbary leopard, are now extinct and critically endangered, respectively. Relict populations of the West African crocodile persisted in the Draa river until the 20th century.    The Barbary macaque, a primate endemic to Morocco and Algeria, is also facing extinction due to offtake for trade   human interruption, urbanisation, wood and real estate expansion that diminish forested area \u2013 the macaque's habitat.  Trade of animals and plants for food, pets, medicinal purposes, souvenirs and photo props is common across Morocco, despite laws making much of it illegal.     This trade is unregulated and causing unknown reductions of wild populations of native Moroccan wildlife. Because of the proximity of northern Morocco to Europe, species such as cacti, tortoises, mammal skins, and high-value birds (falcons and bustards) are harvested in various parts of the country and exported in appreciable quantities, with especially large volumes of eel harvested \u2013 60 tons exported to the Far East in the period 2009\u20122011.    == Politics =="
