With the aim of developing Malaysia into a medical tourism destination, 5 per cent of the government social sector development budget is spent on health care.   The population in concentrated on Peninsular Malaysia   where 20 million of approximately 28 million Malaysians live.  70 per cent of the population is urban.  Kuala Lumpur is the capital  and the largest city in Malaysia,   as well as its main commercial and financial centre.   Putrajaya, a purpose-built city constructed from 1999, is the seat of government,   as many executive and judicial branches of the federal government were moved there to ease growing congestion within Kuala Lumpur.   Due to the rise in labour-intensive industries,   the country is estimated to have over 3 million migrant workers; about 10 per cent of the population.   Sabah-based NGOs estimate that out of the 3 million that make up the population of Sabah, 2 million are illegal immigrants.   Malaysia hosts a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 171,500. Of this population, approximately 79,000 are from Burma, 72,400 from the Philippines, and 17,700 from Indonesia. Malaysian officials are reported to have turned deportees directly over to human smugglers in 2007, and Malaysia employs RELA, a volunteer militia with a history of controversies, to enforce its immigration law.
