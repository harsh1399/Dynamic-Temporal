By about 1000 BC, the development of wet-rice cultivation and bronze casting in the Ma River and Red River floodplains led to the flourishing of the \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture, notable for its elaborate bronze drums. At this time, the early Vietnamese kingdoms of V\u0103n Lang and \u00c2u L\u1ea1c appeared, and the culture's influence spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Maritime Southeast Asia, throughout the first millennium BC.        ===Dynastic Vietnam=== File:Nanyue.svg|thumb|left|Map showing ancient Nam Viet at its greatest extent. thumb The legendary H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng dynasty of the H\u00f9ng kings is considered the first Vietnamese state, known in Vietnamese as V\u0103n Lang. In 257 BC, the last H\u00f9ng king was defeated by Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n, who consolidated the L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t and \u00c2u Vi\u1ec7t tribes to form the \u00c2u L\u1ea1c, proclaiming himself An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng. In 207 BC, a Chinese general named Zhao Tuo defeated An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng and consolidated \u00c2u L\u1ea1c into Nanyue. However, Nanyue was itself incorporated into the empire of the Chinese Han Dynasty in 111 BC after the Han\u2013Nanyue War.  For the next thousand years, Vietnam remained mostly under Chinese rule.   Early independence movements, such as those of the Tr\u01b0ng sisters and Lady Tri\u1ec7u, were only temporarily successful, though the region gained a longer period of independence as V\u1ea1n Xu\u00e2n under the Anterior L\u00fd Dynasty between 544 and 602 AD.   By the early 10th century, Vietnam had gained autonomy, but not true independence, under the Kh\u00fac family.  In 938 AD, the Vietnamese lord Ng\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n defeated the Chinese forces of the Southern Han state at B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River and regained full independence for Vietnam after a millennium of Chinese domination.   Renamed as \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (''Great Viet''), the nation enjoyed a golden era under the L\u00fd and Tr\u1ea7n dynasties. During the rule of the Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t repelled three Mongol invasions.   Meanwhile, Buddhism flourished and became the state religion.  Following the 1406\u20137 Ming\u2013H\u1ed3 War which overthrew the H\u1ed3 Dynasty, Vietnamese independence was briefly interrupted by the Chinese Ming Dynasty, but was restored by L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, the founder of the L\u00ea Dynasty. The Vietnamese dynasties reached their zenith in the L\u00ea Dynasty of the 15th century, especially during the reign of Emperor L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng (1460\u20131497). Between the 11th and 18th centuries, Vietnam expanded southward in a process known as ",
