Historically, Austrians were regarded as Germans, since Austria was part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation until its ending and as part of the German Confederation until the Austro-Prussian war in 1866 which resulted in Austria being excluded from Germany by Prussia. Following the founding of the nation-state German Empire in 1871 without Austria, and along with the events of World War II and Nazism, Austrians have developed their ''own'' distinct national identity and in the modern day do not consider themselves as \"Germans\",   although Austria's biggest ethnic group still are Austrian Germans at 88%.    An estimated 13,000 to 40,000 Slovenes in the Austrian state of Carinthia (the Carinthian Slovenes) as well as Croats (around 30,000)   and Hungarians in Burgenland were recognised as a minority and have had special rights following the Austrian State Treaty ( cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" rules=\"all\" style=\"width:; float:right; margin:1em; background:#fff; border: solid #aaa; font-size:100%;\" |- style=\"background:#ddd",

        "'''8%''' answered that ''\"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force\"''.  While northern and central Germany was the origin of the Reformation, Austria and Bavaria were the heart of the Counter-Reformation in the 16th and 17th centuries, when the absolute monarchy of Habsburg imposed a strict regime to restore Catholicism's power and influence among Austrians.     The Habsburgs for a long time viewed themselves as the vanguard of Catholicism and all other confessions and religions were repressed.  In 1775, Maria Theresa gave official permission to the Mechistarist Congregation of the Armenian Catholic Church to settle in the Habsburg Empire.  In 1781, in the era of Austrian enlightenment, Emperor Joseph II issued a Patent of Tolerance for Austria that allowed other confessions a limited freedom of worship. Religious freedom was declared a constitutional right in Cisleithania after the Austro-Hungarian ''Ausgleich'' in 1867 thus paying tribute to the fact that the monarchy was home of numerous religions beside Roman Catholicism such as Greek, Serbian, Romanian, Russian, and Bulgarian Orthodox Christians (Austria neighboured the Ottoman Empire for centuries), Calvinist, Lutheran Protestants and Jews. In 1912, after the annexation of Bosnia Hercegovina in 1908, Islam was officially recognised in Austria.  Austria remained largely influenced by Catholicism. After 1918, First Republic Catholic leaders such as Theodor Innitzer and Ignaz Seipel took leading positions within or close to Austria's government and increased their influence during the time of the Austrofascism; Catholicism was treated much like a state religion by Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg.",
