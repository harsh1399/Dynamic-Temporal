Usually, the whole of the Caribbean to the northeast, and sometimes the Guyanas, are also included.  According to one source, the term \"Central America\" was used as a synonym for \"Middle America\" at least as recently as 1962.",

        "For the people living in the five countries, formerly part of the Federal Republic of Central America there is a distinction between the Spanish language terms \"Am\u00e9rica Central\" and \"Centroam\u00e9rica\".  While both can be translated into English as \"Central America\", \"Am\u00e9rica Central\" is generally used to refer to the geographical area of the seven countries between Mexico and Colombia, while \"Centroam\u00e9rica\" is used when referring to the former members of the Federation emphasizing the shared culture and history of the region.",
