During proprietary rule, the Bahamas became a haven for pirates, including the infamous Blackbeard (''circa'' 1680\u20131718). To put an end to the 'Pirates' republic' and restore orderly government, Great Britain made the Bahamas a crown colony in 1718 under the royal governorship of Woodes Rogers. After a difficult struggle, he succeeded in suppressing piracy.   In 1720, Rogers led local militia to drive off a Spanish attack.  During the US War of Independence in the late 18th century, the islands became a target for US naval forces under the command of Commodore Esek Hopkins. US Marines occupied the capital of Nassau for a fortnight.  In 1782, following the British defeat at Yorktown, a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau. The city surrendered without a fight. Spain returned possession of the Bahamas to Great Britain the following year, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Before the news was received, however, the islands were recaptured by a small British force led by Andrew Deveaux.  After US independence, the British resettled some 7,300 Loyalists with their slaves in the Bahamas, including two thousand from New York ||",
