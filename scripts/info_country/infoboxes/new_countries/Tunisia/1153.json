The Constitution of Tunisia, adopted 26 January 2014, guarantees rights for women and states that the President's religion \"shall be Islam\". In October 2014 Tunisia held its first elections under the new constitution following the Arab Spring.   Tunisia (#69 worldwide) is the only democracy in North Africa.    The number of legalized political parties in Tunisia has grown considerably since the revolution. There are now over 100 legal parties, including several that existed under the former regime. During the rule of Ben Ali, only three functioned as independent opposition parties: the PDP, FDTL, and Tajdid. While some older parties are well-established and can draw on previous party structures, many of the 100-plus parties extant as of February 2012 are small. ",
