    "style": "thumb|Monaco in Roman Liguria in Italy, 1st century BC  Monaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as ''Monoikos'', from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (''monos'') \"alone, single\"   + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (''oikos'') \"house\",   which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. According to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods.   As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos.     It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese. An ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.  ===Arrival of the Grimaldi family=== File:\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0413\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0413\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0446\u043e\u043c, \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Francesco Grimaldi depicting the moment of the Rock of Monaco conquest.
