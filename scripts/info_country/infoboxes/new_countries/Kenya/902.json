(3) The State shall\u2013-\u2013- (a) promote and protect the diversity of language of the people of Kenya; and (b) promote the development and use of indigenous languages, Kenyan Sign language, Braille and other communication formats and technologies accessible to persons with disabilities.\"  Kenya is a country located in East Africa with a population of 43 Million people. The country gained its Independence in 1963 from The British masters. The country uses English as its official language and whereas many other countries use English as a necessary alternative, Kenya's young population use English in their day to day life including in homes. the cultural diversity in the country means that Kenya is diversely cosmopolitan and 7 out of every 10 kenyan today have intermarried. whereas tribes remain a huge subject in kenya today, it is not highly regarded in the social economically advancing country in East Africa. Kenya also hosts most of the business transactions that affect the greater East Africa thus English becomes ideal in advancing the prospects of this second world country in the \"silicon Savanna\".",
