Georges Dossin, for example, suggests that it has roots in the Sumerian word for copper (''zubar'') or for bronze (''kubar''), from the large deposits of copper ore found on the island.  Through overseas trade, the island has given its name to the Classical Latin word for copper through the phrase ''aes Cyprium'', \"metal of Cyprus\", later shortened to ''Cuprum''.    Cyprus, more specifically the seashore at Paphos, was also one of the birthplaces given in Greek mythology for Aphrodite, who was known as ''K\u00fdpria''. This was because Astarte, goddess of love and beauty in Phoenician mythology, for whom Cyprus was an important cult centre, was later identified with Aphrodite."
