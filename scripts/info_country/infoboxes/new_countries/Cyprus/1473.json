The Republic of Cyprus occupies the southern two-thirds of the island (59.74%). The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus occupies the northern third (34.85%), and the United Nations-controlled Green Line provides a buffer zone that separates the two and covers 2.67% of the island. Lastly, two bases under British sovereignty are located on the island: Akrotiri and Dhekelia, covering the remaining 2.74%.  ===Climate=== ",

It has been suggested, for example, that it has roots in the Sumerian word for copper (''zubar'') or for bronze (''kubar''), from the large deposits of copper ore found on the island.   Through overseas trade, the island has given its name to the Classical Latin word for copper through the phrase ''aes Cyprium'', \"metal of Cyprus\", later shortened to ''Cuprum''. R. S. P.

The standard demonym relating to Cyprus or its people or culture is ''Cypriot''. The terms ''Cypriote'' and ''Cyprian'' are also used, though less frequently.  The state's official name in Greek literally translates to \"Cypriot Republic\" in English, but this translation is not used officially; \"Republic of Cyprus\" is used instead.  ==History=="
