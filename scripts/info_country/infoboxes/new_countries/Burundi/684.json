Following the Second World War, Ruanda-Urundi was classified as a United Nations Trust Territory under Belgian administrative authority.  During the 1940s, a series of policies caused divisions throughout the country. On 4 October 1943, powers were split in the legislative division of Burundi's government between chiefdoms and lower chiefdoms. Chiefdoms were in charge of land, and lower sub-chiefdoms were established. Native authorities also had powers.  In 1948, Belgium allowed the region to form political parties.  These factions contributed to Burundi gaining its independence from Belgium, on the 1st of July 1962.  ===Independence=== File:Flag of Burundi (1962-1966).svg|thumb|alt=flag white saltire cross on green and red background with plant in centre white rondel|Flag of the Kingdom of Burundi (1962\u20131966). thumb On 20 January 1959, Burundi's ruler Mwami Mwambutsa IV requested Burundi's independence from Belgium and dissolution of the Ruanda-Urundi union. ||",
