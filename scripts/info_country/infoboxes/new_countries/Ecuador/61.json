    "style": "right|Ingapirca ruins northeast of Ca\u00f1ar canton, Ca\u00f1ar Province  Before the arrival of the Incas, a variety of different families of Native American peoples settled in Ecuador, who had different languages due to the fact they came from different places. Some sailed to Ecuador on rafts from Central America, others came to Ecuador via the Amazon tributaries others descended from northern South America, and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes or by sailing on rafts.  Eventually these groups developed similar cultures even though their languages were unrelated because they lived in the same environment. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture, the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life, and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting and gathering way of life.  Over time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations rose throughout Ecuador such as the Valdivia Culture and Machalilla Culture on the coast, the Quitus (near present day Quito), and the Ca\u00f1ari (near present day Cuenca). Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.  In the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes decided to cooperate and form villages; thus, the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals were formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their leaders, a group of nations formed confederations. One region was consolidated under a confederation called the Shyris, which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions and whose political and military power was under the rule of the Duchicela blood line.  ===Inca era=== File:Funeralesdeatahualpa luismontero.png|thumb|One of the main events in the conquest of the Incan Empire was the death of Atahualpa, the last Sapa Inca on 29 August 1533 When the Incas arrived they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers - Topa Inca Yupanqui and Huayna Capac - to absorb these confederations into the Inca Empire. The native confederations that gave them the most problem were deported to far away areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were deported to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the Inca Empire in 1463 sharing the same language. In contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and natives more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these natives withdrew to the interior and resorted to guerrilla tactics. As a result, this hampered any kind of Inca expansion into the Amazon basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador. The natives of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived. Be that as it may, the Amazonian natives and the Cayapas of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.  Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a civil war. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac from a European disease that spread into Ecuador created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claims that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito, and he gave the rest to Hu\u00e1scar, who was to rule from Cuzco. He willed that his heart was to be buried in his favourite city, Quito, and his body to be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco. Hu\u00e1scar did not recognize his father's will since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Atahualpa was ordered by Hu\u00e1scar to attend his father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Hu\u00e1scar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Hu\u00e1scar was captured, and Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with Hu\u00e1scar.  A small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa. Pizarro promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. However, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.  === Colonization === File:Quito-San Diego-01.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish Historical Center in Quito File:Pizarroshipbuilding.jpg|thumb|right|Shipwrights from Francisco de Orellana's expedition building a small brigantine, the ''San Pedro''. Disease plagued the indigenous population during the first decades of Spanish rule \u2014 a time when the natives were also forced into the ''encomienda'' labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, Quito became the seat of a real audiencia (administrative district) of Spain and part of the Viceroyalty of Peru and later the Viceroyalty of New Granada.  After nearly 300 years of Spanish colonization, Quito was still a small city of only 10,000 inhabitants. It was here, on August 10, 1809, that the first call for independence from Spain was made in Latin America, under the leadership of the city's ''criollos'' like Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, \"''Luz de Am\u00e9rica''\" (\"Light of America\"), comes from the fact that this was the first successful attempt to produce an independent and local government. Although it lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America. ",
