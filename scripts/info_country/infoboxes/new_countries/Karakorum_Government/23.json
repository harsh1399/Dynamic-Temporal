    "quote": "When the Bolsheviks prevailed in the Altai region, there was a second try to establish the Oirot Republic. In 1921, at Biysk, the republic was proclaimed again, and the tri-band of blue, white, and blue, with the red swastika in the center, was hoisted. The white band was wider than the blue ones and the swastika is a solar symbol commonly used by many nations in that part of Asia. It wasn't a successful attempt at independence, but at the regional Soviet meeting at Tomsk, on July8, 1921, the re-establisment of the Oirot Republic was, at least, discussed. The meeting was attended by some leaders of the Oirot nationalism - Anichin and Konzychakov.",
