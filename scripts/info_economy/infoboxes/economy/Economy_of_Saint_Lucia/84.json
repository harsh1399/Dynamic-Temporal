Tourism, the island's biggest industry, main source of jobs & income and foreign-exchange, accounts for 65% of GDP. Agriculture, which was once the biggest industry, now contributes to less than 3% of GDP, but still accounts for 20% of jobs.clarify",
    "date": "May 2020 The banana industry is now on a decline due to strong competition from low-cost Latin American producers and reduced European trade preferences, but the government has helped revitalize the industry, with 13,734 tonnes exported in 2018. Agricultural crops grown for export are bananas, mangoes and avocados. The island is considered to have the most diverse and well-developed manufacturing industry in the Eastern Caribbean.   Saint Lucia has been able to attract many foreign businesses and investment, particularly in its tourism sector by the promotion of Invest Saint Lucia and the Citizenship by Investment Program. The island is ranked 52 overall for ease of doing business (World Bank's 'Doing Business 2012' study). Saint Lucia is also ranked 13th in the world for dealing with construction permits and getting electricity.",
