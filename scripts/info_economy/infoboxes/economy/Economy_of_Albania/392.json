The busiest and largest seaport is the Port of Durr\u00ebs. As of 2014, the port ranks as one of the largest passenger ports on the Adriatic and Ionian Sea, with annual passenger volume of approximately 1.5 million. Other seaports include Vlor\u00eb, Sarand\u00eb, and Sh\u00ebngjin. The ports serve an extensive system of ferries connecting numerous islands and coastal cities in addition to ferry lines to several cities in Croatia, Greece, and Italy.  The railways in Albania are administered by the national railway company ''Hekurudha Shqiptare'' (HSH). The railway system was extensively promoted by the totalitarian regime of Enver Hoxha, during which time the use of private transport was effectively prohibited. Since the collapse of the former regime, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership and bus usage. Whilst some of the country's roads are still in very poor condition, there have been other developments (such as the construction of a motorway between Tirana and Durr\u00ebs) which have taken much traffic away from the railways.citation needed",
