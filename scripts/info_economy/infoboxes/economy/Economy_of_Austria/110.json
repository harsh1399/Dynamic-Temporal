    "date": "September 2009 Many of the country's largest firms were nationalised in the early post-war period to protect them from Soviet takeover as war reparations. For many years, the government and its state-owned industries conglomerate played a very important role in the Austrian economy. However, starting in the early 1990s, the group was broken apart, state-owned firms started to operate largely as private businesses, and a great number of these firms were wholly or partially privatised. Although the government's privatisation work in past years has been very successful, it still operates some firms, state monopolies, utilities, and services. The new government has presented an ambitious privatisation programme, which, if implemented, will considerably reduce government participation in the economy. Austria enjoys well-developed industry, banking, transportation, services, and commercial facilities.  Austria has a strong labour movement. The Austrian Trade Union Federation (\u00d6GB) comprises constituent unions with a total membership of about 1.5 million\u2014more than half the country's wage and salary earners. Since 1945, the \u00d6GB has pursued a moderate, consensus-oriented wage policy, cooperating with industry, agriculture, and the government on a broad range of social and economic issues in what is known as Austria's \"social partnership\". The \u00d6GB has often opposed the Sch\u00fcssel government's programme for budget consolidation, social reform, and improving the business climate, and indications are rising that Austria's peaceful social climate could become more confrontational.",
