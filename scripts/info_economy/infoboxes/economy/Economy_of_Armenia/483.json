The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed economic system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. Because of political instability and the threat of war, the Armenian economy did not have a chance to develop. The problem reached its peak during the new military clashes in 2020. The war lasted 44 days, starting from 27 September 27 until 10 November, and the result was the worst condition for Armenian Economy. After the war the public debt of Armenia reached to 70% of GDP, making the economy more fragile. The economy suffered of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
