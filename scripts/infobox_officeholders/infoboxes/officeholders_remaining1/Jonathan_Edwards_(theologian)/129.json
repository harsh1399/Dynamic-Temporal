Edwards \"is widely acknowledged to be America's most important and original philosophical theologian,\"   and one of America's greatest intellectuals.   Edwards' theological work is very broad in scope, but he is often associated with his defense of Reformed theology, the metaphysics of theological determinism, and the Puritan heritage. Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw some of the first fires of revival in 1733-1735 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts.   Edwards' sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,\" is considered a classic of early American literature, which he delivered during another wave of revival in 1741, following George Whitefield's tour of the Thirteen Colonies.   Edwards is widely known for his many books: ''The End For Which God Created the World''; ''The Life of David Brainerd'', which served to inspire thousands of missionaries throughout the nineteenth century; and ''Religious Affections'', which many Reformed Evangelicals read even today.   Edwards died from a smallpox inoculation shortly after beginning the presidency at the College of New Jersey (later to be named Princeton University), and was the grandfather of Aaron Burr.     ==Great Awakening== On July 8, 1731, Edwards preached in Boston the \"Public Lecture\" afterwards published under the title \"God Glorified \u2014 in Man's Dependence,\" which was his first public attack on Arminianism. The leading thought of the lecture was God's absolute sovereignty in the work of salvation: that while it behooved God to create man pure and without sin, it was of his \"good pleasure\" and \"mere and arbitrary grace\" for him to grant any person the faith necessary to incline him or her toward holiness; and that God might deny this grace without any disparagement to any of his character.  In 1733, a religious revival began in Northampton, and reached such intensity, in the winter of 1734 and the following spring, as to threaten the business of the town. In six months, nearly three hundred were admitted to the church. The revival gave Edwards an opportunity for studying the process of conversion in all its phases and varieties, and he recorded his observations with psychological minuteness and discrimination in ''A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God in the Conversion of Many Hundred Souls in Northampton'' (1737).",
