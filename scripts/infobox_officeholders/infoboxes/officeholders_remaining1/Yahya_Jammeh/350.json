He was the second President of the Gambia. As a young army officer, he took power in a 1994 military coup.  He was elected as President in 1996; he was re-elected in 2001, 2006, and 2011. He was defeated by Adama Barrow in the 2016 election.   Although he initially conceded defeat, on 9 December 2016, he later refused to recognise the results.  Jammeh's claim to the presidency became in dispute on 19 January 2017 when Adama Barrow was sworn in as president of The Gambia at a ceremony held at the Gambian embassy in Dakar.     == Biography == President Jammeh joined the Gambian National Army in 1984, was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in 1989,   and in August 1992 became commanding officer of the Military Police of Yundum Barracks.   He received extensive military training in neighboring Senegal,   and military police training at Fort McClellan, Alabama.    === Rise to power === On 22 July 1994, Lt. Yahya Jammeh with a group of young officers in the Gambian National Army seized power from President Sir Dawda Jawara in a military coup by taking control of key facilities in the capital city, Banjul.  The coup took place without bloodshed and met with very little resistance.  The group identified itself as the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC), with the 29-year-old Jammeh as its chairman.   The AFPRC then suspended the constitution, sealed the borders, and implemented a curfew. While Jammeh's new government justified the coup by decrying corruption and lack of democracy under the Jawara regime, army personnel had also been dissatisfied with their salaries, living conditions, and prospects for promotion.
