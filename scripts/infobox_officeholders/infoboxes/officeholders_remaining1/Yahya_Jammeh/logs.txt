Yahya Jammeh with a group of young officers in the Gambian National Army seized power from President Sir Dawda Jawara in a military coup by taking control of key facilities in the capital city, Banjul.

The AFPRC then suspended the constitution, sealed the borders, and implemented a curfew. While Jammeh's new government justified the coup by decrying corruption and lack of democracy under the Jawara regime, army personnel had also been dissatisfied with their salaries, living conditions, and prospects for promotion.

He was the second President of the Gambia. As a young army officer, he took power in a 1994 military coup.  He was elected as President in 1996; he was re-elected in 2001, 2006, and 2011. He was defeated by Adama Barrow in the 2016 election.   Although he initially conceded defeat, on 9 December 2016, he later refused to recognise the results.  Jammeh\'s claim to the presidency became disputed on 19 January 2017 when Adama Barrow was sworn in as president of The Gambia at a ceremony held at the Gambian embassy in Dakar.   On 21 January, he announced his resignation.     == Biography == President Jammeh joined the Gambian National Army in 1984, was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in 1989,   and in August 1992 became commanding officer of the Military Police of Yundum Barracks.   He received extensive military training in neighboring Senegal,   and military police training at Fort McClellan, Alabama.    === Rise to power === On 22 July 1994, Lt. Yahya Jammeh with a group of young officers in the Gambian National Army seized power from President Sir Dawda Jawara in a military coup by taking control of key facilities in the capital city, Banjul.  The coup took place without bloodshed and met with very little resistance.  The group identified itself as the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC), with the 29-year-old Jammeh as its chairman.   The AFPRC then suspended the constitution, sealed the borders, and implemented a curfew. While Jammeh\'s new government justified the coup by decrying corruption and lack of democracy under the Jawara regime, army personnel had also been dissatisfied with their salaries, living conditions, and prospects for promotion.

Foreign observers did not deem these elections free and fair.  He was re-elected on 18 October 2001 with about 53% of the vote; this election was generally deemed free and fair by observers,   despite some very serious shortcomings ranging from overt government intimidation of voters to technical innovations (such as raising the required deposit to stand for election by a factor of 25) to distort the process in favour of the incumbent regime.    A coup attempt against Jammeh was reported to have been thwarted on 21 March 2006; Jammeh, who was in Mauritania at the time, quickly returned home. Army chief of staff Col. Ndure Cham, the alleged leader of the plot,   reportedly fled to neighboring Senegal, while other alleged conspirators were arrested   and were put on trial for treason.   In April 2007, ten former officers accused of involvement were convicted and given prison sentences; four of them were sentenced to life in prison.    Jammeh ran for a third term in the presidential election held on 22 September 2006; the election was initially planned for October but was moved forward because of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.   He was re-elected with 67.3% of the vote and was declared the winner of the election; the opposition candidate Ousainou Darboe finished second, as in 2001. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5369040.stm "Gambian president is re-elected", BBC News, 23 September 2006.
