''Washington Examiner'', July 11, 2007.  Former Republican Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore and Virginia House Del. Robert G. Marshall also announced their candidacies for the seat. The Democratic candidate for his seat was former Governor Mark Warner (no relation), who previously challenged John Warner in the 1996 US Senate election. The eventual Republican candidate was former Governor Gilmore, who was defeated in his election bid by former Governor Warner (D).  On October 2, 2007, Warner was admitted to Inova Fairfax Hospital and underwent surgery to correct atrial fibrillation, or an irregular heartbeat.  He made a full recovery and returned to work within the following week.    On February 25, 2008, he was again admitted to Inova Fairfax Hospital, this time for a scheduled observation of his heart condition.    ==Current life== On December 12, 2008, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence awarded Warner the first ever National Intelligence Distinguished Public Service Medal.  On January 8, 2009, the Secretary of the Navy announced it would name the next ''Virginia''-class submarine after John Warner. USS ''John Warner'' (SSN-785) will be the twelfth ''Virginia''-class submarine.    On February 19, 2009 the British Embassy in Washington announced that Queen Elizabeth II will name John Warner an honorary Knight Commander for his work strengthening the American-British military alliance.  As a non-British citizen, the title of Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire only allows Warner to put the Post-nominal letters KBE after his name.     ==Election results==",
