    "conviction_penalty": "Initially sentenced to 6\u00bd years imprisonment. Reduced to 42 months following appeal and re-sentencing and after the sentence had largely been served.   Black was convicted on four counts in U.S. District Court in Chicago on 13 July 2007. He was sentenced to serve 6\u00bd years in federal prison and to pay Hollinger $6.1 million, in addition to a fine of US$125,000. Appeals resulted in two of Black's three criminal fraud charges being vacated, and his conviction for obstruction of justice was upheld. Black was initially found guilty of diverting funds for personal benefit from money due to Hollinger International, and of other irregularities. The alleged embezzlement occurred when the company sold certain publishing assets. He was also found guilty of one charge of obstruction of justice.    In the initial verdict, Black was fined $125,000 and sentenced to 6\u00bd years in prison, serving a total of 37 months after two fraud charges were overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, leaving one fraud charge and one obstruction of justice charge, and the improper receipt of $285,000, which was disclosed and approved but incompletely documented, and civil penalties from the SEC. The 6\u00bd year sentence was reduced to 3\u00bd years.   The $6.1 million fine to the SEC was reduced to $4.1 million in 2013.",
