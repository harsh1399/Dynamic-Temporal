Caroline Kennedy was born at Cornell Medical Center in New York City, 15 months after her parents had a stillborn daughter named Arabella. Caroline was named after her maternal aunt, Caroline Lee Bouvier, and her maternal great-great-grandmother, Caroline Maslin Ewing. Her younger brother, John Jr. (commonly known as \"John-John\"), was born three years after her. A second brother, Patrick, died of a lung ailment two days after his premature birth in August 1963. Caroline and John-John lived with their parents in the Washington, D.C. neighborhood of Georgetown. When Caroline was only three years old, Inauguration of her father was sworn in as President of the United States and the family later moved into the White House. Caroline attended kindergarten in classes organized by her mother, Jackie, and was often photographed riding her pony Macaroni around the White House grounds. A photo of a young Caroline with Macaroni in a news article inspired singer-songwriter Neil Diamond to write his hit song \"Sweet Caroline\", a fact he revealed only when performing it for her 50th birthday. ||",
