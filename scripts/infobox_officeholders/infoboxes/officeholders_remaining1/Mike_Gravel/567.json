These districts were without designated seats.  Therefore, it is impossible to determine a direct predecessor or successor, especially with the higher turnover of legislative seats which existed back then.  Gravel served from District 8 with William H. Sanders (1963-1964);  Bennie Leonard, Keith H. Miller, James C. Parsons, Jack H. White, William C.
