Llanto|publisher=Philippine Institute for Development Studies|date=December 2002    At the age of 18, Marcos was charged with the assassination of Julio Nalundasan, a political opponent of his father, Mariano Marcos. Both were arrested and held until they were released by Supreme Court Justice José P. Laurel, who declared that Marcos was not guilty of the crime.  Marcos served during World War II. As part of his election campaign, he would later claim to have been "the most decorated war hero in the Philippines". In fact, he received only three medals. Prior to Marcos\'s presidency, he served as a member of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 and of the Philippine Senate from 1959 to 1965, where he was also Senate President from 1963 to 1965.  He was elected President in 1965 and the Philippine national debt then grew from $2 billion to $30 billion. US corporations in the Philippines prospered: an explanation as to why the US did not protest Marcos\'s imposition of martial law in 1972. The US corporations prospered because the Philippines was a former colony of the United States, and was heavily reliant on the American economy to purchase agricultural goods such as sugar, tobacco, coconut, bananas, and pineapple. The Carter Administration engineered an $88 million World Bank loan to Marcos, increased military aid to him by 300%, and called him a "soft dictator". The loan was used to build infrastructure projects all over the country. In contrast, a 1976 Amnesty International report had alleged 88 government torturers, the allegations of which were never proven or documented. By 1977, the armed forces had quadrupled and over 60,000 Filipinos had been arrested for political reasons. In fact, the same military expansion also happened with the United States and South Korea, while no records of the 60,000 Filipinos allegedly imprisoned were ever documented by primary sources. In 1981, Vice President George H. W. Bush praised Marcos for his "adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic processes".name=BushMarcos|group=lower-alpha|There is some disagreement between sources about whether President Bush said \'\'principle\'\'   ||||url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pqj8GFCg7MC|', "root['23']": '&dq=principl', "root['25']": '1986 |vicepresident = Fernando López  (1965–1973)  Arturo Tolentino  (Feb. 1', "root['30']": '1965 |term_end      = February 25, 1986 |vicepresident = Fernando López  (1965–1973)  Arturo Tolentino  (Feb. 16–25, 1986)  |primeminister = Himself  (1978–1981)  Cesar Virata  (1981–1986)  |predecessor   = Diosdado Macapagal |successor     = Corazon Aquino |office2       = 3rd Prime Minister of the Philippines |term_start2   = June 12, 1978 |term_end2     = Ju', "root['31']": "name=BushMarcos|group=lower-alpha|There is some disagreement between sources about whether President Bush said ''principle'", "root['year']": '1992', "root['dipstyle']": 'His Excellency', "root['offstyle']": 'Your Excellency', "root['altstyle']": "left||Marcos at the White House in 1966.

From 1946 to 1947 Marcos was a technical assistant to Manuel Roxas, the first president of the independent Philippine republic. He was a member of the House of Representatives (1949–59) and of the Senate (1959–65), serving as Senate president (1963–65). In 1965 Marcos, who was a prominent member of the Liberal Party founded by Roxas, broke with it after failing to get his party’s nomination for president. He then ran as the Nationalista Candidate for president against the Liberal president, Diosdado Macapagal. The campaign was expensive and bitter. Marcos won and was inaugurated as president on December 30, 1965. In 1969 he was reelected, becoming the first Philippine president to serve a second term. During his first term he had made progress in agriculture, industry, and education. Yet his administration was troubled by increasing student demonstrations and violent urban guerrilla activities.

Hoping to present an alternative to both Marcos and the increasingly powerful New People’s Army, Benigno Aquino Jr, returned to Manila on August 21, 1983, only to be shot dead as he stepped off the airplane. The assassination was seen as the work of the government and touched off massive antigovernment protests. An independent commission appointed by Marcos concluded in 1984 that high military officers were responsible for Aquino’s assassination. To reassert his mandate, Marcos called for presidential elections to be held in 1986. But a formidable political opponent soon emerged in Aquino’s widow, Corazon Aquino, who became the presidential candidate of the opposition. It was widely asserted that Marcos managed to defeat Aquino and retain the presidency in the election of February 7, 1986, only through massive voting fraud on the part of his supporters. Deeply discredited at home and abroad by his dubious electoral victory, Marcos held fast to his presidency as the Philippine military split between supporters of his and of Aquino’s legitimate right to the presidency. A tense standoff that ensued between the two sides ended only when Marcos fled the country on February 25, 1986, at U.S. urging. He went into exile in Hawaii, where he remained until his death.  Evidence emerged that during his years in power Marcos, his family, and his close associates had looted the Philippines’ economy of billions of dollars through embezzlements and other corrupt practices. Marcos and his wife were subsequently indicted by the U.S. government on racketeering charges, but in 1990 (after Marcos’s death) Imelda was acquitted of all charges by a federal court.
