Llanto|publisher=Philippine Institute for Development Studies|date=December 2002   At the age of 18, Marcos was charged with the assassination of Julio Nalundasan, a political opponent of his father, Mariano Marcos. Both were arrested and held until they were released by Supreme Court Justice Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel, who declared that Marcos was not guilty of the crime.  Marcos served during World War II. As part of his election campaign, he would later claim to have been \"the most decorated war hero in the Philippines\". In fact, he received only three medals making him the only president to have received medals for wartime valor. Prior to Marcos's presidency, he served as a member of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 and of the Philippine Senate from 1959 to 1965, where he was also Senate President from 1963 to 1965.  He was elected President in 1965 and the Philippine national debt then grew from $2 billion to $30 billion, which was used to fund many infrastructure projects such as the San Juanico Bridge, Heart Center, Lung Center, National Children's Hospital, North Luzon and South Luzon Expressways (the first superhighways in Southeast Asia), and the Light Rail Transit (LRT). US corporations in the Philippines prospered: an explanation as to why the US did not protest Marcos's imposition of martial law in 1972. The US corporations prospered because the Philippines was a former colony of the United States, and was heavily reliant on the American economy to purchase agricultural goods such as sugar, tobacco, coconut, bananas, and pineapple. The Carter Administration engineered an $88 million World Bank loan to Marcos, increased military aid to him by 300%, and called him a \"soft dictator\". The loan was used to build infrastructure projects all over the country. In contrast, a 1976 Amnesty International report had alleged 88 government torturers, the allegations of which were never proven or documented. By 1977, the armed forces had quadrupled and over 60,000 Filipinos had been arrested for political reasons. In fact, the same military expansion also happened with the United States and South Korea, while no records of the 60,000 Filipinos allegedly imprisoned were ever documented by primary sources. In 1981, Vice President George H. W. Bush praised Marcos for his \"adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic processes\".name=BushMarcos|group=lower-alpha|There is some disagreement between sources about whether President Bush said ''principle''   ||||url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pqj8GFCg7MC|",
