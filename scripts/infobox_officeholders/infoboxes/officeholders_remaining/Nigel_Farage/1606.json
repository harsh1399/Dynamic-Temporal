Farage said that UKIP aspired to come top of the European elections, but Neil suggested UKIP were still seen as \"unprofessional, amateur and even unacceptable\".  In the same interview, Farage described Baroness Warsi as \"the lowest grade Chairman the Tory Party has ever had\".  He was voted politician of the year by the online service MSN.    ===2013 local elections=== In May 2013 Farage led UKIP to its best performance in a UK election. The party received 23 per cent of the vote in the local elections, winning 147 council seats, and placing it only 2 points behind the governing Conservative Party and 9 points ahead of the Liberal Democrats. Farage was mobbed by well-wishers as he made his way to his favourite pub, the Marquis of Granby, for a celebratory drink. ",
