Sharif studied business at Government College and later law at the University of Punjab before entering politics in the later 1970s. In 1981, Sharif was appointed by the military government as the Minister of Finance for the province of Punjab. Backed by a loose coalition of conservatives, he was elected as the Chief Minister of Punjab in 1985 and re-elected after the end of martial law in 1988. In 1990, Sharif led a conservative alliance to victory, leading him to become the Prime Minister. Later it was blamed that the election was rigged in favor of Sharif by the Pakistani intelligence through channeling millions of rupees into his election campaign. ||",
