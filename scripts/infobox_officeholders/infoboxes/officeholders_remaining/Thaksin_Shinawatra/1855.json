He initiated many eye-catching policies that distinguished him from his predecessors.   They affected the economy, public health, education, energy, social order, drug suppression and international relations. He gained one re-election victory. Protesters Jam Bangkok, but Rural Thais Love the Leader. ''The New York Times'', 6 March 2006   Thaksin's most effective policies were reducing rural poverty  and the introduction of universal healthcare, allowing him to galvanise the vast and largely untapped support base of the rural poor, especially in the populous northeast.   His Cabinet consisted of a broad coalition of academics, former student leaders, and former leaders of the Palang Dharma Party, including Prommin Lertsuridej, Chaturon Chaisang, Prapat Panyachatraksa, Surapong Suebwonglee, Somkid Jatusripitak, Surakiart Sathirathai, and Sudarat Keyuraphan. Traditional regional power brokers also flocked to his government.  However, his government was increasingly accused of dictatorship, demagogy, corruption, conflicts of interest, human rights offences, acting undiplomatically, using legal loopholes and displaying hostility towards a free press. A highly controversial leader, he has also been the target of numerous allegations of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9, treason, usurping religious and royal authority, selling assets to international investors, and religious desecration.    ===Economic policies=== Thaksin's government designed its policies to appeal to the rural majority, initiating programs like village-managed microcredit development funds, low-interest agricultural loans, direct injections of cash into village development funds (the SML scheme), infrastructure development, and the One Tambon One Product (OTOP) rural small and medium enterprise development program.  Thaksin's economic policies helped Thailand recover from the 1997 Asian financial crisis and substantially reduce poverty. GDP grew from 4.9 trillion baht in 2001 to 7.1 trillion baht in 2006. Thailand repaid its debts to the International Monetary Fund two years ahead of schedule.  Income in the northeast, the poorest part of the country, rose by 46% from 2001 to 2006.   Nationwide poverty fell from 21.3% to 11.3%.  Thailand's Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, fell from .525 in 2000 to .499 in 2004 (it had risen from 1996 to 2000) ).   The Stock Exchange of Thailand outperformed other markets in the region. After facing fiscal deficits in 2001 and 2002, Thaksin balanced the national budget, producing comfortable fiscal surpluses for 2003 to 2005. Despite a massive program of infrastructure investments, a balanced budget was projected for 2007.   Public sector debt fell from 57 per cent of GDP in January 2001 to 41 per cent in September 2006.   Foreign exchange reserves doubled from US$30 billion in 2001 to US$64 billion in 2006.

Critics say Thaksinomics is little more than a Keynesian-style economic stimulus policy re-branded. Others claimed that the policies got the rural poor \"hooked on Thaksin's hand-outs.\"    Thaksin helped legalise Thailand's massive underground lottery system numbers game (Thai: \u0e2b\u0e27\u0e22) to be run by the Government Lottery Office. Lottery sales of approximately 70 billion baht (US$2 billion) were used for social projects, including the \"One District, One Scholarship\" program. The Thaksin government also privatised MCOT, a large television and radio broadcaster.    After the 2006 coup, many of Thaksin's economic policies were ended, the OTOP program was rebranded, the Government Lottery Office's program was deemed illegal, and the government nationalised several media outlets and energy companies. However, economists from Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) published a report indicating that many of the populist policies had not boosted the economy and some were by coincidence. ",
