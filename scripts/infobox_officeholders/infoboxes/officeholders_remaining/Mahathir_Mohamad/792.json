        "the dispute over the island Pedra Branca.   On Lee Kuan Yew's death in March 2015, Mahathir wrote a blog chedet.cc entitled \"Kuan Yew and I\". He expressed his sorrow and grief at the loss of Lee. He said that he often disagreed with the veteran Singaporean leader but bore him no enmity for the differences of opinion on what was good for the newborn nation to thrive. He wrote that with Lee's death, ASEAN had lost the strong leadership of both Lee as well as President Suharto of Indonesia who had died earlier in 2008.   Many political analysts believe that with Lee's death, Mahathir is the last of the \"Old Guard\" of Southeast Asia.    In April 2016, the 1st Anniversary of Lee Kuan Yew's death. Mahathir told the media that Singaporeans must value Lee Kuan Yew's contributions because he industrialised Singapore. He said: \"That is one achievement that we need to recognise.\" With Lee, Mahathir \"had no problems.\" He said that he does not view Lee \"as an enemy and all that, but as a Singapore leader who had his own stand that was not the same with the stand of Malaysia.\"    ====Bosnia and Herzegovina==== In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mahathir has been noted as a particular significant ally of that nation. He was influential in the establishment of an OIC summit in Karachi in 1993 to discuss the need of weapons for Bosnia during the Bosnian War. Mahathir also opened the bridge of the Malaysian-Bosnian and Herzegovinian friendship in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo.   On 11 November 2009, he also chaired closed-door meeting of leading investors at the Malaysia Global Business Forum \u2013 Bosnia, which was also attended by then president Haris Silajd\u017ei\u0107.    ====Developing world==== Among developing and Islamic countries, Mahathir is generally respected."
