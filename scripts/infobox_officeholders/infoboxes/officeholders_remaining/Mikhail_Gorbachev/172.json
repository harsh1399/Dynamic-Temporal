His attempts at reform helped end the Cold War, and also ended the political supremacy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and dissolved the Soviet Union. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990.  ==Early life== Gorbachev faced a tough childhood under the totalitarian leadership of Joseph Stalin; his paternal grandfather was sentenced to nine years in the gulag for withholding grain from the collective's harvest <r",

Glasnost hastened the development of the nationalities problem.
