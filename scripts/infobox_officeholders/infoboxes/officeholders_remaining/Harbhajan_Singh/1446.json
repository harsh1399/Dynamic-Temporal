        "in India's 1st innings, becoming the first no. 8 batsman to score back-to-back test centuries.    After an ordinary performance with the ball in the 5-match ODI series in West Indies in June 2011 (where he was the vice captain to skipper Suresh Raina) (took 4 wickets from 3 matches, best of 3/32), he helped his team revive from dire straits in the 1st Test in Sabina Park at Kingston, Jamaica. With India struggling at 85/6, he along with Suresh Raina initiated a counter-attack to string an aggressive 146-run partnership with Suresh Raina(82 off 115 balls, 15 fours) to help India reach 246. Harbhajan scored 70 from 74 balls (10 fours, 1 six).  ===2011 removal form squad=== Following a few poor performances, Harbhajan was injured in India's tour of England in the summer/monsoon of 2011 and was ruled out of the rest of the series. Harbhajan was also not selected for the Australian tour and the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh. He was, however, included in 30 probables for the World T20 tournament held in Sri Lanka in September 2012.     He was recalled to the Test squad after a gap of more than a year against New Zealand at the end of August 2012.   Harbhajan was dropped from the test team after the 2013 series against Australia. He was called back to the test team after 2 years for a solitary test against Bangladesh.  ===2015\u20132016 Inclusion=== Following  performances in IPL for Mumbai Indians in 2015 and 2014, he was included in the test team captained by Virat Kohli against Bangladesh for the one-off test match in Fatullah. He took 3 wickets in that test to  overtake Wasim Akram in the list of most test match wickets to become the ninth highest wicket-taker in Tests.   He was then called up for the  ODI and T20I teams when a second-string Indian side toured Zimbabwe to play 3 One-day and 2 Twenty-20 matches. Though he did not take many wickets in that tour, he was impressive maintaining a tight line and stopping the flow of runs.  Harbhajan returned with figures of 2/29 in his first T20 international over two and a half years. He was in the squad for the 3 test away series against Sri Lanka led by Virat Kohli. He replaced injured Ashwin in series against South Africa. He was also part of the team that played 3 T20I matches against Australia,   home series against Sri Lanka, Asia Cup in Bangladesh. He played only one match in the Asia Cup against UAE.   He was also part of the T20 World Cup that took place in India but did not play any of the matches.    ===2017 Champions Trophy Exclusion=== Harbhajan was again excluded from the Indian squad for the 2017 Champions Trophy in England. After hearing of his exclusion, Harbhajan claimed he did not receive the same \"privileges\" other veteran cricketers, namely MS Dhoni, have been afforded by the national selectors.   After the media pounced on this comment, Harbhajan claimed the media frenzy took his statement out of proportion.    ==Controversies== ===1998 Suspension=== Harbhajan was fined and given a suspended ban for one ODI by the match referee in his first international series, when his on-field behaviour was adjudged to breach the ICC Code of Conduct. The incident in question was his altercation with Ricky Ponting after dismissing him.     === Altercations with Andrew Symonds and Sreesanth ===",
