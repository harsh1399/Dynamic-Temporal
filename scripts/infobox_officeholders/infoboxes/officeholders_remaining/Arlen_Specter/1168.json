He is the senior United States Senator from Pennsylvania and currently the fifth oldest in the chamber. Specter was a member of the Democratic Party until 1965, when he enlisted as a Republican in order to challenge the Democratic district attorney of Philadelphia.   Elected to the Senate in 1980, Senator Specter staked out a spot in the political center.   He has conservative views on crime, gun control and national security, voting to confirm John Roberts and Samuel Alito during President George W. Bush's second term; at the same time, he holds liberal views on abortion rights, immigration, and the environment.  In April 2006, he was selected by ''Time'' as one of America's Ten best Senators.    On April 28, 2009, Specter announced that, after 44 years as an elected Republican, he was returning to the Democratic Party, ",
