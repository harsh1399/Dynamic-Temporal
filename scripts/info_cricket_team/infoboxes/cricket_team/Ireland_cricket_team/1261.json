    "time": "\"cricinfo history\"/>  The game gained popularity until the early 1880s. The land war in the 1880s resulting from the Irish Land Commission and a ban on playing \"foreign\" games, in practice, British, by the Gaelic Athletic Association set back the spread of cricket. The ban was lifted in 1970, and before then anyone playing foreign games,  such as cricket was banned from the Irish games such as hurling and Gaelic football. Irish teams toured Canada and the US in 1879, 1888, 1892, and 1909. On top of this, Ireland defeated a touring South African side in 1904.<ref name",
