Piazzi had only been able to track Ceres for a couple of months, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data\u2014three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.  Gauss, who was 23 at the time, heard about the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801&mdash;just about a year after its first sighting&mdash;and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree. In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th century orbital prediction that his work&mdash;published a few years later as ''Theory of Celestial Movement''&mdash;remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation.Fact",
