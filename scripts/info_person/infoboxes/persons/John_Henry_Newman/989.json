    "issues": " The general rule among Roman Catholics is to celebrate canonised or beatified persons on the date of their ''dies natalis'', the day on which they died and are considered born into heaven.   However, Newman's ''dies natalis'' is 11 August, the same day as the obligatory memorial of Saint Claire of Assisi in the General Roman Calendar which would take precedence. Thus, once Newman was beatified, the Congregation of the Oratory and the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales opted to place Newman's optional memorial on 9 October, the date of his conversion to Catholicism.",
