He is the founder and primary creative force behind the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, and was previously associated with the bands Option 30, Exotic Birds, and Tapeworm, among others.  As of 2007, Reznor split his ties with Interscope Records, and is now an independent, unsigned musician.  Reznor began creating music early in his life, and cites his sheltered Western Pennsylvania childhood as an early influence.  After being involved with a number of synthesizer-based bands in the mid-80s, Reznor gained employment at Right Track Studios and began creating his own music during the studio's closing hours under the moniker Nine Inch Nails.  Reznor's first release as Nine Inch Nails, ''Pretty Hate Machine'', was a commercial success, and he has since released seven major studio releases.  Outside of Reznor's chief project Nine Inch Nails, he has contributed to many other artists' albums, including Marilyn Manson and more recently Saul Williams.  In 1997, Reznor appeared in ''Time'' magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and ''Spin'' magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music.\"<ref name",
